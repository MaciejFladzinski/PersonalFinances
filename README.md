# PersonalFinances
The main purpose of the application, in addition to allowing the user to save and read both credits and debits, is an algorithm that facilitates the planning of long-term expenses, as well as the ability to analyze finances based on graphs.

If compilation failed, the localized path to the javafx-sdk library is probably missing. It should be downloaded from the official website and added in the tab "configurations" -> "VM options".

In my case:
"--module-path
//Users/maciekfladzinski/Documents/javafx-sdk-14.0.1/lib
--add-modules
javafx.controls, javafx.fxml ".
